# Image Deblurring using DeblurGAN


This project implements a GAN-based architecture for single image motion deblurring, trained on the GoPro dataset. The generator network restores sharp details from blurred images using adversarial learning and perceptual loss derived from VGG16 features. The final model achieves a PSNR of 26.42 and SSIM of 0.87, producing visually and perceptually sharp outputs.
